        <h2>Background of Montgomery County, PA</h2>
      <p>Montgomery County, locally also referred to as Montco, is a county located in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As of the 2010 census, 
          the population was 799,874, making it the third most populous county in Pennsylvania, after Philadelphia and Allegheny Counties, 
          and the 71st most populous in the United States. The county seat is Norristown. Montgomery County is very diverse,
          ranging from farms and open land in the extreme north of the county to densly populated neighborhoods in South and Central Montgomery 
          County.Montgomery County is included in the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is a suburban 
          county northwest of Philadelphia, and marks part of the region's northern border with the Lehigh Valley region of the state to the north. 
          In 2010, it was the 51st wealthiest county in the country (measured by median household income). In 2008, it was named the 9th Best Place 
          to Raise a Family by Forbes. The county was created on September 10, 1784, out of land originally part of Philadelphia County. 
          The first courthouse was housed in the Barley Sheaf Inn. It is believed to have been named either for Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general killed in 1775 while attempting
            to capture Quebec City, or for the Welsh county of Montgomeryshire (which was named after one of William the Conqueror's main 
            counselors, Roger de Montgomerie), as it was part of the Welsh Tract, an area of Pennsylvania settled by Quakers from Wales.
             Early histories of the county indicate the origin of the county's name as uncertain.</p>
